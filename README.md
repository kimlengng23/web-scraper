A simple web scraper using Python and MongoDB.

Required Tools:

1. Python 3.X
2. MongoDB Commmunity Server 7.X or above

Required Packages:

1. pip install bs4
2. pip install pymongo

Note:
We pair Beautiful Soup with MongoDB for fast write and read.
Using a different SQL database is doable, but it's much slower.
If we want to render JavaScript, we will need more tools like Selenium.

Enjoy!
